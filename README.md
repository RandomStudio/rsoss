Some guidelines and best practices.


## Forking public repos (not our own)
When forking a project to improve/contribute, members (with repo create privileges) should see the option to fork either to their private account or to the Organization:

![forking public repos](forking-public.png "forking publicly")

If this is a work-related project (it is being done on company time and/or is being used in the process of client projects, then it is a good candidate to be forked under the Org.



## Brand new repos
When we create something that is useful to us and potentially useful to others, this should be created under the Random Studio Org (or transferred there if necessary).

## Who gets the credit?
It is important to remember that even when a repo is "owned" by the Org (it was started under the Random Studio Org or ownership was transferred), all commit activity is attributed to the individual **users**.

This is a good thing:
* Users get credit for their work publicly (it shows up on their GitHub profile under their activity)
* However, the repos owned by the Org do not show up under each user's list of repositories, on their GitHub profiles
* We can track who is responsible for what
* We can also allow outsiders to contribute (in a controlled way) to anything we're working on
